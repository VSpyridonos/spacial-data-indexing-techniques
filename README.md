# spacial-data-indexing-techniques
Development of indexing and searching techniques for spacial data by creating an R-tree.
<br>
<h1>Program functionalities</h1>

<p><h2>Part 1: Creating the R-tree</h2>
Given a file that contains the coordinates of rectangles that are MBRs of spatial objects, implements sort-tile-recursive (STR) to read the rectangles from the file and create an in-memory R-tree that contains them. Details about STR can be found here: <a>https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA324493.pdf</a> 
</p>

<p><h2>Part 2: R-tree queries</h2>
Implements range queries on the R-tree that was created and prints the results. The three types of queries are: range intersection query, range inside query and containment query. Results are printed.
